# React Pizza CO.

## Introduction

This document outlines the planning and development of a simple yet functional pizza ordering application. The purpose of this project is to create a user-friendly web application that enables customers to order pizzas from the comfort of their homes.

## Features Overview

- **No Account Needed**: Users can interact with the system without the need to create an account.
- **Dynamic Menu**: The pizza menu is retrieved from an API, allowing for live updates.
- **Cart System**: Users can add multiple items to their cart.
- **Simple Order Process**: Users can place an order by providing their name, phone number, and address.
- **GPS Integration**: The app attempts to capture the user's location to assist with delivery.
- **Priority Orders**: Users can opt for priority delivery at an additional cost.
- **Order Tracking**: Each order receives a unique ID, which can be used to track the order status.
- **Post-Order Priority**: Users have the option to mark orders as priority even after placement.
- **Cash on Delivery**: Payment is collected upon delivery, eliminating the need for in-app payment processing.
